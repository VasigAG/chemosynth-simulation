This project was a fun endeavour.
This ecosystem simulation involves a multi-step computational process that integrates biology, chemistry, and ecology. 
It later became clear that such simulation can be a check for the validity of the converse of Gaia's theory.
The Gaia hypothesis, also known as Gaia theory, proposes that living organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth form a complex, self-regulating system that maintains conditions for life. 
The converse would imply that a sustained condition for life would mean that an ecosystem of such life form exists?
